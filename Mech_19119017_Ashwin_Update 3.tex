\section{Introduction}

Finances of this venture would be exciting to do. Initially it would be very minimal as we need to gain popularity.
\\
In this term project I will be discussing different financial models. After that I'll be looking for a model which could be used for our venture "Sadabahar".
\\
Sadabahar is a one stop solution for multiple plant problems. We have a wide range of products and services which range from plants to their pots and from gifting to packaging. Our unique selling point is that we provide a connectivity between customers and experts, in order to help our customer whenever they need it.
